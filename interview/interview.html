								<p class="plus">“Nook” is the word that came to mind when I was feeling around for a way to describe Donald Judd’s library in his singularly beautiful five-story loft in the heart of SoHo. The library is tucked away in a corner of what was once Judd's working space, a floor of the building that is as spare as any of his hard-edged works.</p>

								<strong class="tit">Internet Poetry - By Nick Laird</strong>
								<p class="plus">IOn a quiet street on a hill on the outskirts of Oslo,Norway, is a museum built by an artist to house his sculptures, his paintings, and his remains. The building itself is a monument to the macabre. The door is imposing, the heavy sort that youhave to bend down and lean into, its knob a cast-bronze coiled snake. A low passageway to an inner door requires a shimmy and a crouch. It is rumored that Emanuel Vigeland (1875–1948) wanted visitors to bow to the urn that contained his ashes as they entered and exited the space</p>

The little fishing village and bay, caught in the giant lobster pincer of Cape Town’s False Bay, has a long pier, brightly painted boats, and fishmongers gutting the day’s catch on hosed-down stone slabs. </p>

										<p class="plus">When I first entered Alexander Shulgin’s library,in Lafayette, California, I began photographing the books as quickly and thoroughly as I could, starting at the tops of the shelves and moving down, then across, shelf by shelf, to ensure that I had documented everything.In a house filled with people who have lived their lives under the shadow of government surveillance, I didn’t want to look as if I were engaged in some sort of clandestine activity—especially when I was simply embarrassed by how fanatically obsessed I was with Shulgin and his prolific contributions to medicinal chemistry and psychopharmacology. </p>

Or, how is The Golden Notebook like thisbunch of flowers: arranged in a white trough balanced on two little feet, like nipples; asymmetrical and oddly lawless, combining the plain (Leatherleaf Fern), the symbolic (Star of Bethlehem), the luscious (Persian Buttercup), the common (Red Carnation), and an unidentifiable spray of shimmering bronze?For her show at the New Museum in New York earlier this year, Camille Henrot, who is interested in systems of taxonomy, interpreted the Japanese art of ikebana to translate titles from her library into exotic flower arrangements.Each “book” in Is It Possible To Be A Revolutionary and Like Flowers? was displayed in a different kind of vessel, and each choice of flower was personal and associative, taking into account the names of the books, the Latin and common names of the flowers, and the plants’ reputed and actual pharmacological powers.</p>
